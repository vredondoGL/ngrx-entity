# ngrx-entity

## Problems I had before to find NGRX entities 

When using the redux pattern, over time some parts of the program turns very common and tend to get repeated very often, parts like reducers, actions, seems to be pretty much the same between modules but for different types, doing the process of creating a CRUD takes too much time and the code gives you the feeling it could get somehow easy to reuse and customize based on your needs
